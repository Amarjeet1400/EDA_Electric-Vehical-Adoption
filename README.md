# Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis: Global Perspective

## 1. Overview
This project analyzes global electric vehicle (EV) sales data to understand key factors influencing EV adoption and the challenges hindering widespread uptake. The study includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on sales trends, regional disparities, and market dynamics. Visualization reports are also developed in Power BI to complement the analysis.

## 2. Problem Statement
The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for combating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Despite growing awareness of the benefits of EVs, various challenges slow down their adoption. This analysis aims to explore global EV sales and identify the drivers and barriers affecting the market.

## 3. Data Sources
The dataset was obtained from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), featuring a comprehensive range of columns relevant to electric vehicle data in the USA. It includes details such as country, city, state, electric range of vehicles, and more.

## 4. Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** Used for data analysis and EDA.
  - **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express.
- **Power BI:** Developed a visualization report for additional insights and stakeholder presentations.

## 5. Methodology
The project involves:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
3. Visualization of global sales trends, demographics, and factors affecting EV adoption.
4. Analysis of regional differences in EV preferences and ownership.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of EV registrations, sales, and demographic trends.
- Identification of key drivers and barriers to electric vehicle adoption.
- Insights into regional disparities and preferences in EV ownership.

## 7. Visualization
Power BI reports provide interactive visuals and dashboards, offering a deeper understanding of the factors influencing EV sales globally.

## 8. Conclusion
This analysis offers valuable insights into the dynamics of EV adoption, helping policymakers, industry stakeholders, and investors make informed decisions. By understanding the factors driving or impeding EV growth, we can accelerate the shift towards a sustainable transportation future.
